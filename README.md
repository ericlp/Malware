# MALware
We aspire to bring together people through anime preferences.

## Background
4 IT-students with limited knowledge about every single framework and language included in the project, fights against the world and their compilers in a quest for redemption.

The MALware project is a project meant to create a simple webapp allowing users to coordinate their viewing experiences together. The name is derived from MyAnimeList (MAL), which is now unrelated as we became ip-banned, significantly slowing down development - so we migrated to a similar service called kitsu.io (but the name would be less fun if it reflected the new site, so it remained).

## Team

## Setup instructions

In theory, the python backend requires the two librarires Flask and requests, which can be downloaded with 

```pip install Flask```

```pipenv install requests```.

Then, to do some form of local testing you simply need to set up a virtual enviroment and Flask variables like 

```python3 -m venv venv```

```export FLASK=malware.py``` which is far less harmful than it sounds, 

and to run,

```flask run```

This will, by default, start something at ```localhost:5000```.
